# File-System-Browser
A minimalist file explorer that you can browse through local disk partitions, tested on Windows 10.
It should work on all Windows distributions.  
You can get the .exe version from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vM1UfZWzNAiy_8pMgdgVWtT_UOJUtmvY

Those are the external modules that I have used:
- Tkinter (for UI)  
- Pillow (for images)  
- Pyinstaller (for .exe compilation)  

Here are some images for the showcase:

Btw, the 'open' button only works for folders.

Do not forget to let me know if you find any bugs or you think you have a better approach.
