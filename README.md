# File-Browser
A minimalist file explorer with which you can browse through local disk partitions, tested in windows.  
You can get the .exe version from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vM1UfZWzNAiy_8pMgdgVWtT_UOJUtmvY

Those are the external modules that i have used:
- Tkinter (for GUI)  
- Pillow (for images)  
- Pyinstaller (for .exe compilation)  

Do not forget to tell me if you find any bugs or you think you have a better approach.
